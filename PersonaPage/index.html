                  Today, there are various gaming consoles and devices that people play games with. I have decided to
                  focus on one of them, a Play Station 4 controller. Playstation is one of the most widely used gaming
                  consoles and the controller has a lot of buttons and keys that the user can interact with.
                  Furthermore, this interface is in public view and it does not only have simple interactive components.
                  The controller contains multiple buttons, joysticks, triggers, and a touch pad.

                          Using the UI keyboard with a controller is annoying and hard. It takes far more time to type
                          things using the controller than when typing on a computer

                          Both personas have some similarities with some differences. First, both personas represent the
                          user who does not use PS4 from day-to-day basis, and also focuses on the fact that the user
                          has some experiences using a computer and/or other consoles such as XBox. Now, the first thing
                          that is most important to note is that the PS4 controller must be used with the PS4 in this
                          case. It is true that there are softwares that allows PS4/XBox controllers to be used on
                          computers, but in both personas, I assumed that PS4 controllers are only used when using PS4.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the case of persona 1, I focused on how the user would feel and experience when touching
                          the PS4 / PS4 controller for the first time. Clearly, one has to set up their account,
                          purchase a game, connect to the internet, etc. Most or all of these steps require a user to
                          use the controller, and most importantly, it involves a lot of console side UI keyboard inputs
                          (ex. typing keyword when searching for an app, entering wifi password). This can take a lot of
                          time especially when compared to keyboard inputs on a standard PC, so that is what I focused
                          on. In other words, this persona focuses on potential additional features that could be added
                          to the controller to ease the keyboard inputs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the case of persona 2, I focused on the strengths and weaknesses of the controller itself.
                          Figuring out sensitivity of the keys and buttons, how to plug microphones into the controller,
                          how it fits the user's hand is focused. This persona is made from the previous interview
                          section where users mentioned how the controller can not fit well for people with smaller
                          hands, or if one has a big hand, that it is hard to press a certain combination of buttons at
                          the same time.

                  Below is the storyboard for persona 1 from previous section. The person is new to Play Station, and
                  the end goal is to purchace and launch the game. However, since he is renting his friend's
                  PlayStation, the original set up of the device is completed. He just needs to get used to the PS4
                  controller and get a sense of how to navigate through the platform. Although this story board might
                  not seem to reflect the user experience of the PlayStation4 Controller, navigating through the console
                  requires getting used to the controller. Thus, setting up wi-fi, going to the store, launching the
                  game and taking a look at the key mapping setting does describe the user experience of using the
                  controller.

                  <p>
